# Artistic Style Transfer using CNN
* This repository contains an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow, allowing you to apply artistic styles from one image to the content of another.

# Installation
   !pip install tensorflow-addons
* **Requirements**
   -Python 3.x
   Jupyter Notebook
   TensorFlow
   NumPy
   Matplotlib.
  # Running the Notebook
* **Set Paths**:

     Update the paths for your content and style images within the notebook.

* **Adjust Parameters** :

     Modify image sizes, optimization iterations, learning rates, and other parameters as needed.

* **Execute Cells**:

     Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. You can do this by clicking on a cell and pressing Shift + Enter.

* **View Results**:

     After running the notebook, the generated image will be displayed, combining the content of the chosen image with the 
     artistic style of another image.
     Structural Similarity Index(SSIM)  is also calculated.

**Notes**
   Make sure to have your content and style images available and adjust the file paths accordingly in the notebook cells.
   Experiment with different images and parameters to achieve diverse style transfer result
